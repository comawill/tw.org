Q: How do you import existing tasks into taskd?

Hello,

I'd like to give a try to taskd and Mirakel and I already have a bunch of task created using the regular taskwarrior program. How can I import those tasks into taskd?

I skimmed through the documentation shipped with taskd but didn't find anything about that.

A: This is documented, run "man task-sync".

A: I don't think the answer is clear in the documentation, actually. But what you want, Louis, is handled automatically when you run task sync initialize.
